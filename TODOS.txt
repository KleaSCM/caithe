- ✅ Proper command construction with escaping
- ✅ Error handling for Hyprland communication

### Testing Suite
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite with 6 specialized test files
- ✅ Mathematical algorithm validation tests
- ✅ Core functionality tests
- ✅ Real wallpaper integration tests
- ✅ Cache implementation tests
- ✅ Performance and stress tests
- ✅ All tests building and passing successfully

### Build System
- ✅ xmake configuration with proper dependencies
- ✅ ImGui, GLFW, stb, nlohmann_json package integration
- ✅ System library linking (X11, OpenGL, etc.)
- ✅ Multiple build targets for different test scenarios
- ✅ Professional compilation flags and optimization

## 🚧 IN PROGRESS

### GUI Implementation
- 🔄 ImGui integration (partially implemented, needs header fixes)
- 🔄 Main application window and UI framework
- 🔄 Settings panel with JSON configuration
- 🔄 About dialog with feature descriptions

## 📋 REMAINING TASKS

### High Priority

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES

### Build Issues
- [ ] ImGui backend headers not found (need proper include paths)
- [ ] Some unused parameter warnings in DisplayManager
- [ ] Missing FileUtils::normalizePath implementation

### Runtime Issues
- [ ] Config directory creation sometimes fails
- [ ] Image validation returns false for non-existent test files (expected behavior)
- [ ] Hyprland integration requires image preloading

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

1. **Fix ImGui Integration**: Resolve header include issues and complete GUI implementation
2. **Implement Wallpaper Browser**: Create the main user interface for browsing and selecting wallpapers
3. **Add Configuration System**: Implement JSON settings persistence
4. **Polish User Experience**: Add previews, fuzzy finder, and advanced features
5. **System Integration**: Add autostart and background daemon functionality
